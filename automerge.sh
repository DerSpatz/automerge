# automerge - written by Bastian Mohing using ChatGPT
# 
# Automerge is a tool to merge directories on different drives created by mergerfs into a single directory on a single disk
# It can be useful to consolidate files that belong together, like media files and their metadata, to reduce disk spin ups
# 
# Use this tool with caution, as it applies changes to you file system structure. 
# Use the dry-run option -d to see the actual changes before they are written to th disks.
#
# For more information, run automerge -h or automerge --help.
# 
# Automerge needs to be installed into you local binary path (usually /usr/local/bin/) and can then be called from the directory you want to merge.
